# Your First API Test

In the previous tutorial we looked at how to write a simple web test with Serenity BDD. But Serenity isn't just for web tests: Serenity BDD also provides tight integration with [Rest Assured](https://rest-assured.io/), a popular open source library for testing REST APIs.

## Pre-requisites
To run this tutorial, you will need a few things installed on your machine:
* **Java**: Serenity BDD is a Java library, so you'll need a recent JDK installed. JDK 1.8 or higher should be fine.
* **A Java IDE**: You'll also need a Java Development Environment such as IntelliJ or Eclipse (and a working knowledge of Java).
* **Git**: We'll be using a starter project on Github, and the sample code for this project lives on Github too, so I'll be assuming you have a basic understanding of Git.
